### codeSmell 
1. Utility function that are not  in Utility 
2. In parse input function ```option``` is better instead of `type`
3. function name is `poor` in line no 9 and line no 14
4. Order of args in `head.js` and `tail.js`;
5. In main function `fs` object is better to pass 
6. `GetOutputContent` function is too long 
7. IN  `line 15` in `libTest.js` the function is misleading
